Hello,


please find attached my correction requests. 
However, as you apparently made subtle changes like 
removing whitespace, changing URLs, and changing \ldots to \cdots, it is almost 
impossible for me to be sure that I have not overlooked one of these changes, if my only source is the pdf. 
It would be very helpful to at least get a list of all changes you made to the document, such that I know where to look in the pdf!

Regards
  Peter Lammich



## Response to Query 1:

My correct affiliation and contact data is

## l.88 You changed \ldots to \cdots. However, further down, (eg l.98) it's still \ldots. 
     If there is no style-guide enforcing \cdots in l.88, but \ldots in, eg, l.98, please use \ldots consistently!

## l. 343: You removed whitespace: parse_id*and*parse_lit (The * marks missing whitespace)
  !! Please check that this mishap did not happen anywhere else, where I might have overlooked it, or send me a complete list of the changes you made, 
  such that I know where to look for such problems.

## l. 469: Again, you removed whitespace!
  i. e. we implement*Some False*by 1,*Some True*by 2, and*None*by 0. Here, amd_assn

  As the spaces are present in the text data of the pdf, this might be a typesetting issue!
  
## l.783: The proceedings should have appeared by now. Please adjust the reference accordingly.

## l.789: You changed the URL! The correct URL is "http://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/grat/" (The ~ is part of the URL!)

## l.829: The proceedings should have appeared by now. Please adjust the reference accordingly.

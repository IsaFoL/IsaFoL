c Maliciously engineered comment line that exceeds the drat-trim specific limit of 1024 characters. 
c The rest of the comment is interpreted as if it were part of the formula!

c Note that this comment line length exceeds 1024 characters, causing the drat-trim parser to interpret the rest of this line as if it belongs to the formula. Of course, we have engineered this line such that this mis-interpretation will turn the satisfiable formula unsatisfiable, thus making drat-trim reporting the wrong result.

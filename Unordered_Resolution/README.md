# Formalization of First-Order Unordered Resolution #

[This directory](https://bitbucket.org/isafol/isafol/src/master/Unordered_Resolution/) used to contain an Isabelle formalization of unordered resolution for first-order logic. The formalization has been [moved to the Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Resolution_FOL.shtml). 
From AFP version 2018 and forward this includes a formal proof of the unification theorem. It is proved here by loading theories from the [First_Order_Terms entry](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/First_Order_Terms.html) and doing conversions between two entries' definitions of terms. The assumption in the unification locale is then instantiated, and we obtain the completeness theorem from the locale.

## Additional Completeness Results ##

For the JAR paper I proved some additional completeness results compared to the ITP paper. 
They are available the AFP entry from version 2018 and forward.


## Installation ##

* [Download and install the newest version of Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de)
* [Install AFP](https://www.isa-afp.org/using.html)
* Open theories in '/path/to/AFP/Resolution/Resolution_FOL'

Alternatively you can just install Isabelle without AFP, and then download
[the Resolution_FOL entry](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Resolution_FOL.html).
All theories will load except 'Unification_Theorem.thy' and 'Completeness_Instance.thy'
which rely on AFP being installed.

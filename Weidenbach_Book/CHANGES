Since IJCAR 2016's Submission:
* Weidenbach's CDCL
  * In the trail, the level annotation has been removed: annotating the decided literals with
  the level is only an optimisation, but is not necessary for the proof. The annotation has been
  removed from the datatype; i.e. Decided K () ~> Decided K

  * add_init_cls add been removed from CDCL_W and CDCL_W_Restart. CDCL_W_Incremental has its own
    state locale including add_init_cls.

* Two watched literals:
  * CDCL_Two_Watched_Literals is under heavy changes and has been remove temporarly from the ROOT file.

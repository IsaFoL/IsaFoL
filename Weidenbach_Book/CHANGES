Since IJCAR 2016's Submission:
* Weidenbach's CDCL
  * In the trail, the level annotation has been removed: annotating the decided literals with
  the level is only an optimisation, but is not necessary for the proof.

  * add_init_cls add been removed from CDCL_W and CDCL_W_Restart. CDCL_W_Incremental has its own
    state locale including add_init_cls.

  * the clauses of the state have been abstracted: they can be converted to multiset, but do not
    need to be multiset anymore. This change is useful for implementations.

* Two watched literals:
  * CDCL_Two_Watched_Literals is under heavy changes.

session "CDCL" (Weidenbach_Book) = "Isabelle_LLVM"  +
  description \<open>This session the CDCL calculi (Weidenbach and Nieuwenhuis et al.) and the links between
  both. It also contains a very simple implementation based on lists and two extensions (restart and
  incremental).

  This version is based on the Refinement Framework, to make the two-watched-literals part easier to compile
  (workaround as long as a session cannot have two parents).

This repository contains various ongoing Isabelle formalizations of logical
calculi, collectively called

    **IsaFoL: Isabelle Formalization of Logic**

The goal is to develop lemma libraries and methodology for formalizing modern
research in automated reasoning. Our initial focus is on well-established
ground and first-order calculi, such as DPLL, CDCL, and resolution. Our
inspiration is the IsaFoR/CeTA project (Isabelle/HOL Formalization of 
Rewriting for Certified Termination Analysis) at Universität Innsbruck.

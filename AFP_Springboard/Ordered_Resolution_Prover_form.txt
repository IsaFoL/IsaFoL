Abstract:
  This Isabelle/HOL formalization covers Sections 2 to 4 of Bachmair and Ganzinger's "Resolution Theorem Proving" chapter in the Handbook of Automated Reasoning. This includes soundness and completeness of unordered and ordered variants of ground resolution with and without literal selection, the standard redundancy criterion, a general framework for refutational theorem proving, and soundness and completeness of an abstract first-order prover.

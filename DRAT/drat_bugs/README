*** Problem f1:

The formula is clearly satisfiable, but both forward and backward mode manage to prove UNSAT!
With f1s.drat, also SAT can be proved.

Analysis attempt:
  The literal 1 is set by unit propagation. Although already assigned, it is chosen as resolution
  literal for the RAT check.




*** Problem f2:
Syntactically malformed dimacs-files may produce segfaults.
This could probably be maliciously exploited, or unintentionally corrupt drat-trims
memory and cause other issues (eg wrong proofs). Here: Header missing causes segfault.
But also wrong number of clauses seems to cause memory crapping.
